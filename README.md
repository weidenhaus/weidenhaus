âœ¨ Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in developing web applications, designing cloud infrastructure and creating data integration platforms. I know what it means to take ownership, deliver measurable results and work in great international teams. I am a firm believer in life-long learning and helping others to achieve great things through the means of mentoring is very close to my heart. 

I worked at SAPâ€™s headquarters for 7 years as a development export (staff engineer) and tech lead for their internal adoption and usage reporting, driving end-to-end processes, while being responsible for all technical aspects of the reporting landscape and underlying system architecture.

As a freelance software engineer and consultant in Germany and Switzerland, I have had the honour to work with some of the most innovative international companies in industrial research, high tech and finance.

I lived and worked on three continents and Iâ€™m deeply grateful to have met so many smart and inspiring people along the way, many of whom have become lifelong friends and mentors. I truly love working in software development. It feels good to work on applications that have the potential to bring joy to millions of people and to connect friends and families.
