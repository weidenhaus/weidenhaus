âœ¨ Iâ€™m a full stack software engineer with over 10 years experience in software development and product management. I know what it means to take ownership, deliver measurable results and be a great team player. I am versatile, curious and enthusiastic to take on new problems and to grow not only as a developer, but as a person.

I worked at SAPâ€™s HQ for 7 years as a principal developer and tech lead for their internal adoption and usage reporting, driving end-to-end processes and being responsible for all technical aspects of the reporting landscape and underlying system architecture.
