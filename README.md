ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating awesome web apps, writing efficient backend code, and designing reliable data integration platforms. With 10 years of experience under my belt, I've spent 7 of those years as a tech lead and staff engineer at SAP. I love taking the reins, achieving real results, and working with teams all around the world. Plus, I'm super proud to have been recognized as a Global Talent by the Australian government. Let's connect and chat about all things tech!
