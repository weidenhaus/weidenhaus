<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating awesome web apps, writing efficient backend code, and designing reliable data integration platforms.</p>

<p>With 10 years of experience under my belt, I've spent 7 of those years as a tech lead and staff engineer at SAP. Now, as a proud permanent resident of Australia, I have full working rights in the country, which allows me to bring my skills and experience to even more exciting projects.</p>

<p>I love taking the reins, achieving real results, and working with teams all around the world. Additionally, I'm super proud to have been recognized as a Global Talent by the Australian government.</p>
